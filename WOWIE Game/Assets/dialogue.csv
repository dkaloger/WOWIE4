OpeningScene_,"Harrison: God, how long have I been out here? I can't even see the perimeter fence. I've searched so many of these damned scrap piles and... and nothing.","Harrison: My nerves cannot take much more of this. The silence is unnerving and I feel I'll be attacked any second.","Harrison: (angry grunt) Kal, I blame you for this mess. I'd told you to not try bluffing the raiders. You've not the wits to even try. They do not care where you get the payment, but you do not mess with their income. They see through that shit.","Harrison: Now they want their payment AND an extra payment. And you know their ""extra payment"" is always a ""quest"" to find something impossible so they've an excuse to... to...","Harrison: ""Give us something created in the old world"" they'd said. You know how rare those artifacts are? Of course not.","Harrison: That was hundreds of years ago.","Harrison: (sighs) This box is quite sturdy. Might be a good stool. Whatever.","(Harrison tosses the box aside and it starts whirring.)","Box: STARTUP INITIATED............ AI ONLINE.","Harrison: Oh no no no no no. I should run. Maybe it won't have lasers this time.","(Use WASD to move.)","Box: GREETINGS, HUMAN! You seem to be getting a workout running so fast.","Harrison: H- Huh?","Box: HUMAN! Come back here! Pick me up with the E key and move me elsewhere. Being on the ground is unsightly.","Harrison: Oh God it's a trap, it probably has a knife.","Box: A knife! Do you take me for some barbarian? The pen is mightier than the sword! Or knife.","Harrison: (That's a quote from the old world. Killbots are not equipped with those...)","(Use E to pick up and drop items.)","Box: Thank you! Would you like a painting as a token of my appreciation? I was created to bring your vision to life!","Harrison: I... I've always wanted to know what the old world was like.","Box: A GREAT CHOICE! Get me materials! Like that ore over there!","(Take out your pickaxe and left click to mine materials. Try that melted, unidentifiable metal that might have been something long ago.)","(The box whirs for a minute and outputs a canvas with a painting.)","(It's a strange scene, with impossibly bright sunlight, and impossibly tall buildings. Hundreds of people are walking on the streets.)","Harrison: This painting is beautiful! I've not seen anything like it.","Box: An original creation! Just for you!","Harrison: Thank you. I truly appreciate it. Could we make another one? We've these raiders on our doorstep...","Box: A fellow creative! Yes, this is excellent! Be my apprentice, will you?","Harrison: That sounds interesting. But. Please please please keep it down. It's dangerous out here.","Box: NO! GENIUS CANNOT BE CONTAINED!","Harrison: It's not that it's- Oh shit. Incoming!"
