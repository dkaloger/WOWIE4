  - 'Harrison: God, how long have I been out here? I can''t even see the perimeter
    fence. I''ve searched so many of these damned scrap piles and... and nothing.'
  - 'Harrison: My nerves cannot take much more of this. The silence is unnerving
    and I feel I''ll be attacked any second.'
  - 'Harrison: (angry grunt) Kal, I blame you for this mess. I''d told you to not
    try bluffing the raiders. You''ve not the wits to even try. They do not care
    where you get the payment, but you do not mess with their income. They see through
    that shit.'
  - 'Harrison: Now they want their payment AND an extra payment. And you know their
    ""extra payment"" is always a ""quest"" to find something impossible so they''ve
    an excuse to... to...'
  - 'Harrison: ""Give us something created in the old world"" they''d said. You know
    how rare those artifacts are? Of course not.'
  - 'Harrison: That was hundreds of years ago.'
  - 'Harrison: (sighs) This box is quite sturdy. Might be a good stool. Whatever.'
  - (Harrison tosses the box aside and it starts whirring.)
  - 'Box: STARTUP INITIATED............ AI ONLINE.'
  - "Harrison: Oh no no no no no. I should run. Maybe it won't have lasers this time.\"\r"
