  - Harrison:(Hold Enter to skip) God, how long have I been out here? I can't even
    see the perimeter fence. I've searched so many of these damned scrap piles and...
    and nothing.
  - 'Harrison: My nerves cannot take much more of this. The silence is unnerving
    and I feel I''ll be attacked any second.'
  - 'Harrison: (angry grunt) Kal, I blame you for this mess. I''d told you to not
    try bluffing the raiders.They do not care where you get the payment, but you
    do not mess with their income. They see through that shit.'
  - 'Harrison: Now they want their payment AND an extra payment. And you know their
    ""extra payment"" is always a ""quest"" to find something impossible so they''ve
    an excuse to... to...'
  - 'Harrison: ""Give us something created in the old world"" they''d said. You know
    how rare those artifacts are? Of course not.'
  - 'Harrison: That was hundreds of years ago...'
  - 'Harrison: What am i even supposed to do here?'
  - 'Harrison: And what is a stupid printer doing here,i remember having one of these
    in the old world, never worked. Pfff'
  - 'Box: STARTUP INITIATED............ AI ONLINE.'
  - 'Harrison: Oh no no no no no. I should run. Maybe it won''t have lasers this
    time.'
  - (Use WASD to move and Shift to dash)
  - 'Box: GREETINGS, HUMAN!'
  - 'Harrison: H- Huh?'
  - 'Box: HUMAN! Come back here! Pick me up with Space  and move me elsewhere. Being
    on the ground is unsightly.'
  - 'Harrison: Oh God it''s a trap, it probably has a knife.'
  - 'Box: A knife! Do you take me for some barbarian? The pen is mightier than the
    sword! Or knife.'
  - 'Harrison: (That''s a quote from the old world. Killbots are not equipped with
    those...)'
  - (Press Space to pick up and drop the AI and other items.)
  - 'Box: Thank you! Would you like a painting as a token of my appreciation? I was
    created to bring your vision to life!'
  - 'Harrison: I... I''ve always wanted to know what the old world was like.'
  - 'Box: A GREAT CHOICE! Get me materials! Like that ore over there!'
  - (Grab the pickaxe and move near minerals to mine them. Try that melted, unidentifiable
    metal . Sheep have an apetite for it, deliver 4 wool  to make a complete painting)
  - (The box whirs  and outputs a canvas with a painting,you can take the painting
    to an eisel to improve your prestige,you are the real artist not this AI thing)
  - (It's a strange scene, reminds me of the old world)
  - 'Harrison: This painting is beautiful! I''ve not seen anything like it.'
  - 'Box: An original creation! Just for you!'
  - 'Harrison: Thank you. I truly appreciate it. Could we make another one? We''ve
    these raiders on our doorstep...'
  - 'Box: A fellow creative! Yes, this is excellent! Be my apprentice, will you?'
  - 'Harrison: That sounds interesting. But. Please please please keep it down. It''s
    dangerous out here.'
  - 'Box: NO! GENIUS CANNOT BE CONTAINED!'
  - "Harrison: It's not that it's- Oh shit. Incoming!\"\r"
  - 'Box: USE YOUR GUN ! Dont let them get to me (pickup the gun and fire with LMB,or
    throw it at the enemies with Space)'
  - 'Box: Thank you! you really saved my circuits from those fool brutes '
  - 'Box: Go Explore and bring me minerals to make more paintings(there are 11 eisels
    scattered  around the map),you can refill the Health of the AI with dead sheep'
